    Title: Cover (Web)Letter for WordPress VIP Technical Account Manager Position
    Author: Dylan Meyer

    Description: I got the idea to build a web page as a portion of my application originally from Episode 17 of the Distributed podcast. It 
    seemed like a fun project to showcase my skills and help me stand out, so I decided to take it on. I must also give credit to Spen Taylor 
    (github.com/spen/hello-automattic) who, with a very open-source mentality, posted his HTML code to GitHub after his successful Automattic 
    application all the content and CSS styling is my own, but it was definitely a source of inspiration. In the end, I found that this project
    also helped me organize my thoughts and produce an improved final product.

    FUN FACT: The top-level of this website (www.themeyergroup.org) was build by my dad back in the late 90s (how far we've come!). He was an 
    early PC and internet pioneer from San Diego, before it was cool, who eventually made his living as self-employed a website designer and 
    administrator.

    <div class="panel-body">
        <h1>Hey Automattic!</h1>
        <p class="first">I am so excited to be submitting my application to become a Technical Account Manager (TAM) at WordPress VIP!</p>
        <p>
            I started this journey by writing a more classic cover letter, but found the approach somewhat stale. I had spent 
            considerable time learning WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and version control over the past few months, but 
            that experience was difficult to capture. Thus, I decided to create a webpage to supplement my standard application 
            and provide you with a more engaging experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also found that using a webpage aided me in organizing my thoughts and focusing on what is important: communicating 
            with your audience. In the sections below, I'll discuss...
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How I became obsessed with Automattic and why I want to work for you.</li>
                <li>Why you (Automatticians and WordPress VIP) should want to work with me.</li>
                <li>What I view as my most critical skills for this position.</li>
                <li>How I will immediately contribute to WordPress VIP.</li>
                <li>Some other interesting facts that make me...me!</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            At the end, I'll also provide links to additional resources, including my projects, hobbies, web resume, and adventures.
        </p>
        <p class="last">
            In the end, I hope to provide you with a well-rounded perspective of who I am, what I'm capable of, and why I would be a
            fantastic asset to Automattic. Without further ado, I invite you to explore the sections below. Enjoy!

                        About a year ago, I decided that I needed a career-change and embarked on a long and interesting journey that included
                        making it to the final interviews for the <a href="https://careers.state.gov/work/foreign-service/officer/" target="_blank">
                        U.S. Foreign Service</a>, earning my <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp" target="_blank">
                        PMP</a> certification, and interviewing a diverse set of industry leaders. After researching Automattic extensively and 
                        speaking with Aaron Hohle at length, I knew that I wanted to be an Automattician. Your organizational culture and your 
                        employees' warmth, dedication, and competence are inspiring and the TAM position offers unique and exciting opportunities 
                        in both the responsibilities and clientele.

                    <p>
                        Automattic's culture, rooted in transparency and integrity, and vision, seeking to extend publishing and commerce tools 
                        globally, inspire tens of thousands of people around the world to volunteer to help the movement. In addition, you make 
                        people around the world feel empowered in their work and provide them with the autonomy to pursue interesting problems.
                        These attributes alone set Automattic apart from most other technology companies of comparable success and have convinced
                        me that, by working for you, I would be able to make a tangible and positive impact on the world.

                    <p>
                        As may not surprise you, both your employees and volunteers are prolific and candid in their descriptions of life as an 
                        Automattician. Much of what I have learned has come from the WordPress slack instance, community forums, and individual 
                        blogs. I've also thoroughly enjoyed Matt's podcast, <i>Distributed</i>, and learning about every facet of distributed work. 
                        What is immediately clear is that Automattic honors and empowers its people and the community members care deeply about 
                        each other. Who wouldn't want to be a part of that?

                        On top of joining a great organization and getting to work with intelligent, driven, and empathetic colleagues, the 
                        TechnicalAccount Manager position offers an exciting set of clients and responsibilities. I thrive under pressure and 
                        purpose and would \relish the opportunity to collaborate with business leaders around the world on complex, interesting 
                        problems make me vibrate with excitement. It's also clear that work will never be linear or stale as every debug, expanded 
                        functionality, and site redesign is unique and brings with the opportunity to learn and grow. That combination: incredible 
                        clients, engaging problems, and continual learning, is exactly what I want in a career.

                        At first glance, my experience in software development, geology, and academic research suggests that I am primarily a 
                        researcher and engineer (not a bad thing!). While my strong technical background is undeniable, it does not define me. For 
                        the past 14 years, I've thrived in a diverse set of roles that have provided me with extensive management experience, honed 
                        my interpersonal skills, and made me an amiable and reliable colleague. Automattic's combination of highly collaborative 
                        work and a globally dispersed workforce makes these skills essential tools for every employee.

                        Fresh out of highschool, I started as the manager of a research lab at UC San Diego, where I built a student worker program 
                        and hired, trained, and supervised a 5 to 8-person team. I fostered a culture of creativity, transparency, and equity that 
                        empowered employees to improvise process improvements and bound us together as a team with common purpose. It was incredible 
                        how, as the "shy kid" just months prior, I found this ability to connect with others and make a tangible impact on their lives.

                    <p>
                        In college, while completing dual technical degrees, I continued my managerial and leadership training as a resident
                        advisor. The responsibility I enjoyed most was organizing social events that exposed my residents to new activities and
                        ideas and provided them a fun, safe environment to mingle and bond. The most impactful parts, however, were the times I 
                        mentored residents through hardship, intervened in conflicts, and managed community emergencies. Through these experiences, 
                        I discovered how to listen, how to calm, and how to lead my team and community members.

                        As both a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, the success of my research has been dependent upon continuous 
                        collaboration with my global colleagues. I've always had a small, core team of engineers, technicians, and fellow researchers
                        with whom I worked constantly. However, all labs have limited capabilities, so I occasionally reached out to external experts
                        to develop partnerships, use on their equipment, and get their advice on my work. My individual projects were also part of
                        larger research portfolios, which required that my work align with the overall strategic goals. The sum result was a complex 
                        web of people and institutions maintained by monitoring foundational relationships and dependably communicating progress.

                        My doctoral advisor was unique in his emphasis on his students' communication skills, particularly technical writing, oral
                        presentation, and active listening. I spent countless hours pouring over my manuscripts, seeking to clarify my message and
                        condense my thoughts. I delivered dozens of compelling presentations to diverse audiences, big and small, by distilling
                        years of work into 20-30 minutes. Most importantly, however, I met with key stakeholders and external experts, asking good 
                        questions, absorbing their responses, and acting on their advice. These power skills have proven essential to both my 
                        professional and personal growth.

                    <p>
                        My move to Taiwan in 2018 was life-changing. I've traveled abroad fairly extensively, but the contrast between being a visitor 
                        and being a resident is stark. My time abroad has made me appreciate that local cultures are persistent and it is <u>my</u> 
                        responsibility to adjust, in both life and work, if I am to thrive. I am more resilient, culturally-sensitive, and patient 
                        towards my environment as a result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, while being trainsed by a doctoral student in my Taiwanese research team, I noticed that he was uncomfortable 
                        giving me direct, critical feedback. I attributed his behavior to a culturally-inclined deferrence to my perceived authority 
                        (as the "higher-educated" person), but found that it hindered my progress and ability to contribute. In response, I started 
                        watching for covert signs of discontent and asking additional clarifying questions. This slight behavioral change not only 
                        accelerated my learning, but also led to me developing the autonomous data-processing tool that became my first contribution 
                        to the team. Through a little sensitivity and flexiblity, I was able to vastly improve our communication and my efficacy.

                        Technical Problem Solving
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I've spent the past 10 years of my career learning new, highly-technical skills. I entered my graduate program knowing 
                        nothing about my research field or the experimental methods I would soon master. In a relatively short time, I accumulated 
                        a collection of skills (e.g. hardware engineering, mathematical modeling, 3D data analysis and visualization) uniquely tuned 
                        to my research needs and became an expert in my field. I then repeated the process after moving to Taiwan, as I changed the 
                        focus of my research completely and, thus, started from scratch. Through these experiences, I've perfected not only how to 
                        learn from others, but also how to independently teach myself and be productive in ambiguous environments.
                    </p>
                    <p class="last">
                        At a finer scale, my learning experiences are typically linked to a complex problem that I overcame using increasingly 
                        elegant solutions. Since I was a kid disassembling old radios and VCR players, I have been interested in how things work. 
                        That curiousity morphed with age into how I could build something and, eventually, into how I could prefect it. This 
                        mentality persists to this day and motivates me as I approach any problem, whether debugging code, troubleshooting an 
                        experiment, or detangling complex data. My need to find the <u>right</u> solution has been critical to my success by driving 
                        me to question, experiment, and iterate continuously.

                        As both a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, I brought long-term (3-4 years), high-budget research projects to 
                        completion. I proved adept at disaggregating complex requirements into smaller, digestible components and then dedicating 
                        myself to getting the project done. These projects were highly complex and had inherent risks that could only be mitigated 
                        by careful attention and coordination. Effective and agile project management is becoming essential to growth and resilience 
                        in diverse economic sectors. As a certified project manager, I look forward to tackling your most complex projects and

                        Strategic Location

                    <p class="last">
                        On a practical note, my being located in the APAC timezone and particularly in Taiwan brings with it three key strategic 
                        benefits. First, as far as I can discern, less than 15% of Automatticians reside in this timezone and only a handful are
                        VIP Technical Account Managers. I would prove a critical point of contact for VIP's clients in the US and Europe outside
                        business hours, improving Automattic's sterling customer service. Second, the APAC region is the fasting growing economic 
                        zone in the world with significant opportunities to expand the adoption of WordPress VIP and other services. Taiwan is 
                        strategically located, with ready access to all countries, and would prove to be an important operational base. Finally, 
                        Taiwan itself hosts a fledgling WordPress community, but has incredible technical talent just waiting to be tapped into. I
                        would gladly work with local Automatticians and WordPress contributors to recruit top talent as both volunteers and 
                        employees.

                        On a final note, it is worth mentioning that I'm completely sold on the distributed organizational model. I've worked in a
                        semi-distributed fashion since 2012. I've enjoyed and been productive in
