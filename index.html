    Title: Cover (Web)Letter for WordPress VIP Technical Account Manager Position
    Author: Dylan Meyer

    Description: I got the idea to build a web page as a portion of my application originally from Episode 17 of the Distributed podcast. It 
    seemed like a fun project to showcase my skills and help me stand out, so I decided to take it on. I must also give credit to Spen Taylor 
    (github.com/spen/hello-automattic) who, with a very open-source mentality, posted his HTML code to GitHub after his successful Automattic 
    application all the content and CSS styling is my own, but it was definitely a source of inspiration. In the end, I found that this project
    also helped me organize my thoughts and produce an improved final product.

    FUN FACT: The top-level of this website (www.themeyergroup.org) was build by my dad back in the late 90s (how far we've come!). He was an 
    early PC and internet pioneer from San Diego, before it was cool, who eventually made his living as self-employed a website designer and 
    administrator.

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="panel-body">
        <h1>Hey Automattic!</h1>
        <p>I am so excited to be submitting my application to become a Technical Account Manager (TAM) at WordPress VIP!</p>
        <p>
            I started this journey by writing a more classic cover letter, but found the approach somewhat stale. I had spent 
            considerable time learning WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and version control over the past few months, but 
            that experience was difficult to capture. Thus, I decided to create a webpage to supplement my standard application 
            and provide you with a more engaging experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also found that using a webpage aided me in organizing my thoughts and focusing on what is important: communicating 
            with your audience. In the sections below, I'll discuss...
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How I became obsessed with Automattic and why I want to work for you.</li>
                <li>Why you (Automatticians and WordPress VIP) should want me to work for you as a TAM.</li>
                <li>What I view as my most critical skills for this position.</li>
                <li>How I will immediately contribute to WordPress VIP.</li>
                <li>Some other interesting facts that make me...me!</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            At the end, I'll also provide links to additional resources, including my projects, hobbies, web resume, and adventures.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, I hope to provide you with a well-rounded perspective of who I am, what I'm capable of, and why I would be a
            fantastic asset to Automattic. Without further ado, I invite you to explore the sections below. Enjoy!

<!-- Why I want to work with you -->
<section class="why-you">
    <div class="panel-group" id="accordion1">
        <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">
                <h4 class="panel-title">
                    <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse1">Why You?</a>

            </div>
            <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>
                        As I've embarked on pursuing my next career, I evaluate potential opportunities against a "corporate trifecta." 
                        The three limbs of which consist of the organizational culture and vision, the people that comprise the 
                        organization, and the clients and position responsibilities. I found that Automattic and, more specifically, 
                        WordPress VIP fulfill these requirements spectacularly, as I will expound upon below.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many reasons that I'm interested in joining the Automatticians, but one of the most important is that your 
                        company culture is rooted in a history of open-source and transparency. There is always something inspiring about any 
                        cause that attracts tens of thousands of people around the world to volunteer their time and expertise to the movement. 
                        I attribute much of Automattic success to its ability to make people around the world feel empowered in their work and
                        provide them the autonomy to pursue interesting problems. The result? WordPress.org has become the most successful web
                        design platform in the world, dramatically outpacing its commercial competitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another important draw are the people themselves. As may not surprise you, both your employees and volunteers are 
                        prolific and honest in their descriptions of life as an Automattician. Much of what I have learned has come from the
                        WordPress slack instance, community forums, and individual blogs. I've also thoroughly enjoyed plowing through Matt's
                        podcast, <i>Distributed</i>, and learning about every facet of distributed work. What is immediately clear is that 
                        Automattic honors and empowers its people and the community members care deeply about each other. Who wouldn't want to
                        be a part of that?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final edge of the corporate trifecta consists of the clients and position responsibilities. In this case, WordPress
                        VIP does not fail to impress. I thrive under pressure and purpose and the opportunity to collaborate with business leaders
                        around the world on complex, interesting problems make me vibrate with excitement. It's also clear that work will never be
                        linear or stale as every debug, expanded functionality, and site redesign is unique and brings with the opportunity to
                        learn and grow. That combination: incredible clients, engaging problems, and continual learning, is exactly what I want in
                        a career.

                        At first glance, my experience in software development, geology, and academic research suggests that I am primarily
                        a scientist (not a bad thing!). While my strong technical background is undeniable, it does not define me. Instead, I've
                        found that I am motivated by and thrive in work that requires building relationships and collaborating with others on 
                        complex problems. Automattic's combination of highly collaborative work and a globally dispersed workforce makes these
                        skills essential tools for every employee.

                    <p>
                        As the manager of a research lab at UCSD, fresh out of highschool, I built a student worker program and hired, trained, 
                        and supervised a 5 to 8-person team. I fostered a culture of creativity, transparency, and equity that empowered employees
                        to improvise process improvements and bound us together as a team with common purpose. It was incredible how, as the "shy 
                        kid" just months prior, I found this ability to connect with others and make a tangible impact on their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In college, while completing dual technical degrees, I continued my managerial and leadership training as a resident
                        advisor (RA). The responsibility I most enjoyed were running social events for my residents that exposed them to new
                        activities and ideas or provided them a fun, safe environment to mingle and bond. The most impactful parts, however, were 
                        the handful of times I mentored residents through hardship, intervened in conflicts, and managed community emergencies.
                        Regardless of the task, however, this was an opportunity rooted in and driven by working with people and was incredibly
                        rewarding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an academic, in graduate school and at my current position, the success of my research has been dependent upon my
                        continuous collaboration with colleagues around the world. I had a core team at my institution that I worked with 
                        constantly. I reached out to external experts to visit their labs, train on their equipment, and incorporate that 
                        knowledge into my work. I participated in monthly meetings with 20+ attendees to exchange ideas and constructive 
                        criticism. I presented at international conferences in front of hundreds of people to spark new and interesting 
                        conversations. The need for power skills, such as networking, relationship building, and collaboration, has become a 
                        reality of modern science
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the past 14 years, I've thrived in a diverse set of roles that have honed my interpersonal skills, provided
                        me with extensive management experience, and made me an amiable and reliable collaborator.

                        On a final note, it is worth mentioning that I'm completely sold on the distributed organizational model. I've worked in a
