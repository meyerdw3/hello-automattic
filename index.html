    Title: Cover (Web)Letter for WordPress VIP Technical Account Manager Position
    Author: Dylan Meyer

    Description: I got the idea to build a web page as a portion of my application originally from Episode 17 of the Distributed podcast. It 
    seemed like a fun project to showcase my skills and help me stand out, so I decided to take it on. I must also give credit to Spen Taylor 
    (github.com/spen/hello-automattic) who, with a very open-source mentality, posted his HTML code to GitHub after his successful Automattic 
    application all the content and CSS styling is my own, but it was definitely a source of inspiration. In the end, I found that this project
    also helped me organize my thoughts and produce an improved final product.

    FUN FACT: The top-level of this website (www.themeyergroup.org) was build by my dad back in the late 90s (how far we've come!). He was an 
    early PC and internet pioneer from San Diego, before it was cool, who eventually made his living as self-employed a website designer and 
    administrator.

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div id="intro">
        <h1>Hello Automattic!</h1>
        <p>I am so excited to finally be submitting my application to become a Technical Account Manager (TAM) at WordPress VIP!</p>
        <p>
            I started this journey by writing a more classic cover letter, but found the approach somewhat stale. I had spent 
            considerable time learning WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and version control over the past few months, but 
            that experience was difficult to capture. Thus, I decided to create a webpage to supplement my standard application 
            and provide you with a more engaging experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also found that using a webpage aided me in organizing my thoughts and focusing on what is important: communicating 
            with your audience. In the sections below, I'll discuss...
            <ul>
                <li>How I became obsessed with Automattic and why I want to work for you.</li>
                <li>Why you (Automatticians and WordPress VIP) should want me to work for you as a TAM.</li>
                <li>What I view as my most critical skills for this position.</li>
                <li>How I will immediately contribute to WordPress VIP.</li>
                <li>Some other interesting facts that make me...me!</li>
            </ul>
            At the end, I'll also provide links to additional resources, including my projects, hobbies, web resume, and adventures.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, I hope to provide you with a well-rounded perspective of who I am, what I'm capable of, and why I would be a
            fantastic asset to Automattic. Without further ado, I invite you to explore the sections below. Enjoy!
